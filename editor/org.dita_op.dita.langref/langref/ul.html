<div><p>In an unordered list (&lt;ul&gt;), the order of the list items
is not significant. List items are typically styled on output with a "bullet"
character, depending on nesting level.</p>

 &lt;li&gt;This is an item in an unordered list.&lt;/li&gt;

 element, is part of the list item which contains it.
 &lt;p&gt;This is the contained paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
