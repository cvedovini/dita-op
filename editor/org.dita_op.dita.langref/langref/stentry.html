table cell, like &lt;entry&gt; in &lt;table&gt;. You can place any number

<div class="example"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Example</h2>See <a href="simpletable.html" title="The &lt;simpletable&gt; element is used for tables that are regular in structure and do not need a caption. Choose the simple table element when you want to show information in regular rows and columns. For example, multi-column tabular data such as phone directory listings or parts lists are good candidates for simpletable. Another good use of simpletable is for information that seems to beg for a &quot;three-part definition list&quot;—just use the keycol attribute to indicate which column represents the &quot;key&quot; or term-like column of your structure.">simpletable</a>.</div>

An href attribute is required on the image element, as this attribute creates a pointer to the image, and allows the output formatting processor to bring the image into the text flow. To make the intent of the image more accessible for users using screen readers or text-only readers, always include a description of the image's content in the alt element.">image</a> or <a href="../common/../langref/object.html" title="DITA's &lt;object&gt; element corresponds to the HTML &lt;object&gt; element.">object</a> or <a href="../common/../langref/draft-comment.html" title="The &lt;draft-comment&gt; element allows simple review and discussion of topic contents within the marked-up content. Use the &lt;draft-comment&gt; element to ask a question or make a comment that you would like others to review. To indicate the source of the draft comment or the status of the comment, use the author, time or disposition attributes.">draft-comment</a> or <a href="../common/../langref/required-cleanup.html" title="A &lt;required-cleanup&gt; element is used as a placeholder for migrated elements that cannot be appropriately tagged without manual intervention. As the element name implies, the intent for authors is to clean up the contained material and eventually get rid of the &lt;required-cleanup&gt; element. Authors should not insert this element into documents.">required-cleanup</a> or <a href="../common/../langref/fn.html" title="Use footnote (&lt;fn&gt;) to annotate text with notes that are not appropriate for inclusion in line or to indicate the source for facts or other material used in the text.">fn</a> or <a href="../common/../langref/indextermref.html" title="This element is not completely defined, and is reserved for future use.">indextermref</a> or <a href="../common/../langref/indexterm.html" title="An &lt;indexterm&gt; element allows the author to indicate that a certain word or phrase should produce an index entry in the generated index.">indexterm</a> or <a href="../common/../langref/data.html" title="The &lt;data&gt; element represents a property within a DITA topic or map. While the &lt;data&gt; element can be used directly to capture properties, it is particularly useful as a basis for specialization.

The property itself is expressed by the &lt;data&gt; element. The &lt;data-about&gt; element handles exception cases where a property must be expressed somewhere other than inside the actual subject of the property.
