<div><p>The related information links of a topic (&lt;<span class="keyword">related-links</span>&gt;
element) are stored in a special section following the body of the topic.
After a topic is processed into it final output form, the related links are
usually displayed at the end of the topic, although some Web-based help systems
might display them in a separate navigation frame.</p>

<div class="section">       <div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Processing notes:</span>          <br /><ol>
<li>Prerequisite links are an exception (that is, in which <em><span class="keyword">importance</span>="required"</em> and
the role is compatible–not ancestor/parent/child/descendant/next). Implementations
may (but need not) sort these after the &lt;<span class="keyword">shortdesc</span>&gt;
(all topics) or after the &lt;<span class="keyword">prereq</span>&gt; section (for tasks).</li>

<li>PDF output typically ignores hierarchical links, for example ancestor/parent/child/descendant/next/previous/sibling,
although it may include some child links to produce summaries at the start
of chapters.</li>

<li>Links not in a &lt;<span class="keyword">linklist</span>&gt; will be sorted on output
based on type, role, and importance.</li>

<li>The value of the <em>               <span class="keyword">format</span>         
   </em> attribute defaults to <span class="q">"dita"</span> unless the attribute <em><span class="keyword">scope</span>="external",</em> when
